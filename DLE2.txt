



Sure, let's simplify the explanation:

1. **Getting Ready**: First, we load and take a quick look at our movie review data. We want to understand how many reviews we have, how they're categorized, and how long they are on average.

2. **Preparing the Data**: We convert the text reviews into a format our computer can understand. Think of it like turning words into numbers, which is easier for the computer to work with.

3. **Splitting the Data**: We divide our data into two groups: one for training our model and another for testing how well it performs. This helps us see if our model can generalize beyond the data it was trained on.

4. **Building the Model**: We design our "brain" called a neural network. It's made up of layers that process information in different ways. We create one model with one layer and another with two layers to see which works better.

5. **Training the Model**: We teach our model to understand the patterns in the data. This involves showing it examples and letting it adjust its internal settings to get better at making predictions.

6. **Checking Progress**: As our model learns, we keep an eye on how well it's doing. We look at two things: how accurate it is during training and how well it performs on new, unseen data (validation).

7. **Evaluating Performance**: Once training is done, we put our model to the test using the test data. We want to see if it can correctly predict sentiment (positive or negative) based on reviews it hasn't seen before.

8. **Getting Insights**: We summarize the results and check out metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices to understand where our model excels and where it struggles.

This process helps us build and fine-tune models that can understand and classify sentiment in movie reviews.

   ```
   - This line displays the plot with the generated training and validation accuracy curves.

7. **Printing Model Summary**:
   ```python
   print(model2.summary())
   ```
   - This line prints a summary of the DNN model architecture.

8. **Making Predictions and Evaluating Performance**:
   ```python
   pred = model2.predict(x_test)
   classes_x = np.argmax(pred, axis=-1)
   accuracy_score(y_test, classes_x)
   ```
   - This block makes predictions on the test data (`x_test`) using the trained model (`model2.predict()`).
   - `np.argmax(pred, axis=-1)` extracts the class with the highest probability for each prediction, converting the predictions into class labels.
   - The `accuracy_score()` function calculates the accuracy score by comparing the true labels (`y_test`) with the predicted labels (`classes_x`).

Overall, this code segment provides visualizations of the training and validation accuracy trends over epochs for the DNN model with two hidden layers and evaluates its performance on the test data.
