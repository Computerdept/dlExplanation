Certainly! This code is all about using historical data of Google stock prices to train a model to predict future prices. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Data Setup**: 
   - The code starts by getting historical stock price data for training from a file.
   - It then scales down the prices to make them easier for the model to work with.

2. **Preparing Input and Output**:
   - It creates sequences of 60 consecutive days' stock prices as inputs.
   - The corresponding output for each sequence is the stock price of the next day.
   - This prepares the data for training the model to learn the patterns in the stock prices.

3. **Building the Model**:
   - It sets up a special type of neural network called an LSTM model.
   - This model is good at learning patterns in sequences of data, like time series.

4. **Training the Model**:
   - The model is trained using the prepared input-output pairs.
   - It learns from the historical data to predict future stock prices.

5. **Testing the Model**:
   - The model is then used to predict the stock prices for a set of test data.
   - It hasn't seen this data before, so it's a way to check how well it can predict new prices.

6. **Visualizing the Results**:
   - Finally, the real and predicted stock prices are compared visually.
   - This helps to see how accurate the model's predictions are.

Overall, the goal is to create a model that can learn from past stock prices to make accurate predictions about future prices.






This code snippet imports necessary libraries, uploads a dataset file, and loads the training dataset for Google stock prices. Let's break it down:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout
   ```

2. **Uploading Dataset File**:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   ```
   - This command allows the user to upload a dataset file from their local system to the Google Colab environment.

3. **Loading Training Dataset**:
   ```python
   dataset_train = pd.read_csv('Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv')
   dataset_train.head()
   ```
   - This block reads the uploaded CSV file named 'Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame object `dataset_train`.
   - The `head()` function is used to display the first few rows of the dataset for inspection.

Overall, this code segment sets up the environment, uploads the dataset file, and loads the training dataset for Google stock prices into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis and model training.



This code segment preprocesses the training dataset for the Google stock prices by scaling the values using MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn. Let's break it down:

1. **Extracting Training Data**:
   ```python
   training_set = dataset_train.iloc[:, 1: 2].values
   training_set.shape
   ```
   - This code extracts the 'Open' column from the training dataset (`dataset_train`) and converts it into a NumPy array.
   - The `.shape` attribute is used to check the shape of the extracted training data.

2. **Scaling the Data**:
   ```python
   sc = MinMaxScaler(feature_range = (0, 1))
   training_set_scaled = sc.fit_transform(training_set)
   ```
   - An instance of MinMaxScaler is created with the feature range set to (0, 1), which scales the data to this range.
   - The `fit_transform()` method of the scaler is then applied to the training data (`training_set`), which computes the minimum and maximum values of the training data and scales it accordingly.
   - The scaled data is stored in the variable `training_set_scaled`.

Overall, this code segment preprocesses the training data by scaling it to a range between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning and deep learning models.



This code segment prepares the training data for an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model by creating input-output pairs with a sequence length of 60 timesteps. Let's break it down:

1. **Creating Input-Output Pairs**:
   ```python
   X_train = []
   y_train = []
   for i in range(60, len(training_set_scaled)):
       X_train.append(training_set_scaled[i-60: i, 0])
       y_train.append(training_set_scaled[i, 0])
   ```
   - This loop iterates over the scaled training data (`training_set_scaled`) starting from the 61st timestep.
   - For each iteration, it creates an input sequence (`X_train`) consisting of the previous 60 timesteps and the corresponding output value (`y_train`) at the current timestep.

2. **Converting to NumPy Arrays**:
   ```python
   X_train, y_train = np.array(X_train), np.array(y_train)
   ```
   - After creating the input-output pairs, the lists are converted into NumPy arrays for further processing.

3. **Reshaping Input Data**:
   ```python
   X_train = np.reshape(X_train, newshape=(X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))
   ```
   - The input data (`X_train`) is reshaped into a 3D array to match the input shape expected by the LSTM model.
   - The new shape is `(number of samples, number of timesteps, number of features)`.

4. **Checking Shapes**:
   ```python
   X_train.shape
   y_train.shape
   ```
   - These lines print the shapes of the input data (`X_train`) and the output data (`y_train`), respectively.

Overall, this code segment prepares the training data in the appropriate format for training an LSTM model, with input sequences of 60 timesteps and corresponding output values.

   plt.plot(dataset_train['Open'])
   plt.title("Google Stock Open Prices")
   plt.xlabel("Time (oldest -> latest)")
   plt.ylabel("Stock Open Price")
   plt.show()
   ```
   - This code creates a figure with a size of 18x8 inches.
   - It plots the 'Open' prices from the `dataset_train` DataFrame over time.
   - The title of the plot is set as "Google Stock Open Prices", and the labels for the x-axis and y-axis are specified.
   - Finally, the plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.

   plt.figure(figsize=(18, 8))
   plt.plot(dataset_train['Low'])
   plt.title("Google Stock Low Prices")
   plt.xlabel("Time (oldest -> latest)")
   plt.ylabel("Stock Lowest Price")
   plt.show()
   ```
   - Similarly, this code segment creates another figure with the same size.
   - It plots the 'Low' prices from the `dataset_train` DataFrame over time.
   - The title of the plot is set as "Google Stock Low Prices", and the labels for the x-axis and y-axis are specified.

This code segment prepares the test data for evaluating the LSTM model's performance on predicting Google stock prices. Let's break it down:

1. **Extracting Real Stock Prices**:
   ```python
   real_stock_price = dataset_test.iloc[:, 1: 2].values
   real_stock_price.shape
   ```
   - The code extracts the 'Open' prices from the test dataset (`dataset_test`) and converts them into a NumPy array (`real_stock_price`).
   - The `.shape` attribute is used to check the shape of the extracted real stock prices.

2. **Concatenating Datasets**:
   ```python
   dataset_total = pd.concat((dataset_train['Open'], dataset_test['Open']), axis=0)
   ```
   - This line concatenates the 'Open' prices from both the training and test datasets (`dataset_train` and `dataset_test`) along the vertical axis (axis=0).
   - It creates a combined dataset (`dataset_total`) containing historical prices from both datasets.

3. **Extracting Inputs**:
   ```python
   inputs = dataset_total[len(dataset_total) - len(dataset_test) - 60:].values
   ```
   - The code extracts the input data for the test dataset from the combined dataset.
   - It selects the last 60 days' prices from the combined dataset for testing.
   - The `.values` attribute is used to convert the extracted inputs into a NumPy array.

Overall, this code segment prepares the test data by extracting the real stock prices, concatenating datasets, and extracting input data for testing the LSTM model's predictions.




This code segment reshapes and scales the input data for testing the LSTM model's predictions. Let's break it down:

1. **Reshaping Input Data**:
   ```python
   inputs = inputs.reshape(-1, 1)
   ```
   - The code reshapes the input data (`inputs`) to have only one column.
   - The `-1` argument in the `reshape()` function indicates that NumPy should automatically calculate the appropriate number of rows based on the number of elements in the array, while `1` specifies the number of columns.

2. **Scaling Input Data**:
   ```python
   inputs = sc.transform(inputs)
   ```
   - The reshaped input data is then scaled using the previously created MinMaxScaler (`sc`).
   - This step ensures that the input data is transformed into the same scale as the training data, allowing for consistent model predictions.

3. **Checking Length of Inputs**:
   ```python
   len(inputs)
   ```
   - This line simply checks the length of the scaled input data.

Overall, this code segment prepares the input data for testing the LSTM model's predictions by reshaping it to have a single column and scaling it using the same scaler that was used for the training data.



This code segment generates predictions for the test set using the trained LSTM model (`regressor`). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Creating Test Input Sequences**:
   ```python
   X_test = []
   for i in range(60, len(inputs)):
       X_test.append(inputs[i-60:i, 0])
   X_test = np.array(X_test)
   ```
   - This loop iterates over the scaled input data (`inputs`) to create input sequences for testing.
   - Each input sequence consists of the previous 60 days' stock prices.
   - The resulting sequences are stored in `X_test` as a NumPy array.

2. **Predicting Stock Prices**:
   ```python
   predicted_stock_price = regressor.predict(X_test)
   ```
   - The LSTM model (`regressor`) predicts the stock prices based on the input sequences (`X_test`).
   - The predicted prices are stored in `predicted_stock_price`.

3. **Inverse Scaling**:
   ```python
   predicted_stock_price = sc.inverse_transform(predicted_stock_price)
   ```
   - The predicted stock prices are inverse-transformed to revert them to their original scale.
   - This step is necessary to obtain the predicted stock prices in their original units.

Overall, this code segment generates predictions for the test set using the trained LSTM model and then inverse-scales the predicted prices to their original units for evaluation and analysis.



This code segment visualizes the real and predicted stock prices for Google. Let's break it down:

1. **Plotting Real and Predicted Prices**:
   ```python
   plt.plot(real_stock_price, color='red', label='Real price')

   ```
   - The title of the plot is set as 'Google price prediction'.
   - The x-axis label is set as 'Time'.
   - The y-axis label is set as 'Price'.

3. **Adding Legend and Displaying the Plot**:
   ```python
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```
   - A legend is added to the plot to distinguish between the real and predicted prices.
   - The plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.
